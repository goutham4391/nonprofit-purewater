										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>By the end of the year, the partnership will have provided safe water access to over 10,000 people.</em></strong></p>
<p>Planet Water Foundation, a nonprofit organization that addresses global water poverty by providing clean water access and hygiene education programs, and Hung Yen Knitting &amp; Dyeing Co. Ltd – an Italian leading textile manufacturer operating in Vietnam since 2008 – have completed the deployment of their latest clean water project in Hung Yen Province, Vietnam.</p>
<p>The project took place in Lac Hong Primary School in Văn Lâm, Hung Yen, with volunteers from Hung Yen Knitting and Dyeing Co. Ltd., supporting the Planet Water Foundation team in deploying an AquaTower community water filtration system which will provide the students and surrounding community members with access to clean, safe drinking water for many years to come.</p>
<p>Since the partnership began in 2020, Hung Yen Knitting &amp; Dyeing has supported the deployment of four AquaTower systems. Each AquaTower system produces 1,000 liters of clean, safe drinking water per hour, enough to meet the drinking water requirements of up to 1,800 people, and includes an integrated handwashing station with liquid soap dispensers.</p>
<p>Each project is deployed together with Planet Water’s comprehensive hygiene education program to help spread knowledge on healthy hygiene habits, and Planet Water’s AquaSan mobile surface disinfection system which helps sanitize the school environment.</p>
<p>“We are honored to contribute back to the communities of the Hung Yen Province” said Ms. Claudia Anselmi, General Manager and Director of Hung Yen Knitting &amp; Dyeing.</p>
<p>“Throughout the partnership with Planet Water Foundation, we are proud to see the results that our support has brought to the children in each school we have deployed projects in, giving access to clean and safe drinking water, and making a positive impact to the families and the community surrounding the schools.”</p>
<p>Later this year, the two organizations will be deploying two additional AquaTower projects in Hung Yen province, further extending the impact of the partnership.</p>
<p>“We are extremely grateful for the support of Hung Yen Knitting &amp; Dyeing” said Mark Steele, Founder &amp; CEO of Planet Water. “By the end of this year, through our partnership we will have brought access to clean, safe drinking water to up to 10,800 people, and provided hygiene education to over 4,000 students and community members.”</p>
<p>Following the deployment of each AquaTower project, the Planet Water team will be conducting sustainability visits over the course of four years to ensure the long-term success of each project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The initiative will see 28 AquaTower systems deployed across six countries, complete with advanced water filtration systems and hand-washing infrastructure.</strong></p>
<p>March 17, 2022 &#8211; ​In an effort to bring clean and safe drinking water to those in need, Planet Water Foundation is deploying 28 AquaTower projects across Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, and Vietnam as a part of its Project 24 event. The event, which leads up to World Water Day on March 22, is taking place from March 1 to March 22.</p>
<p>With March considered to be a month of action for organizations looking to make a difference on World Water Day, Planet Water Foundation hosts this event annually to raise awareness of the 2.2 billion people living without access to safe water. This year’s event is projected to bring clean water to over 50,000 beneficiaries living in impoverished communities, and is made possible through the support of Planet Water Foundation’s dedicated corporate partners.</p>
<p>Planet Water Foundation’s AquaTower technology removes bacteria, protozoa, viruses, pathogens and other contaminants greater than 0.01 micron, and provides children and surrounding community members crystal-clean drinking water. </p>
<p>In addition to clean drinking water, Planet Water Foundation’s AquaTower projects also provide rural schools and communities with handwashing and sanitation infrastructure. Handwashing stations are integrated into the base of each AquaTower, and serve as key hygiene resources to recipient schools, with each station offering liquid soap dispensers as well as promotional banner messaging discussing handwashing awareness and best practices featured on each AquaTower. </p>
<p>Planet Water Foundation also supports learning through its activity-based hygiene education program. These school and community-based programs are designed to educate and empower children and their caregivers to create a change in knowledge and behavior of water health and hygiene.</p>
<p>“I am beyond thankful for the support we have received and continue to receive from our sponsors and corporate partners,” said Mark Steele, Founder and CEO of Planet Water Foundation. </p>
<p>“The impact we are making cannot merely be measured by numbers. By bringing clean drinking water to communities in need, we are drastically improving the health and quality of life for thousands of individuals who can now turn their attention to other aspects of life instead of having this challenge continue to be an ongoing concern.” </p>
<p>This year’s Project 24 supporters include Xylem Watermark, Capital One Philippines, The Starbucks Foundation, The Coca-Cola Foundation, Speedo, Electrolux, Flex Foundation, NortonLifeLock, Matouk, Escudo Antibacterial, Vera Bradley, KPS, Freudenberg, Watts Water Technologies Inc., Ludacka Wealth Partners, and Columbia Sportswear.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"15px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size: 15px;">October 13, 2021 &#8211; Planet Water Foundation, a leading non-profit organization that addresses global water poverty by delivering clean water access and hygiene education programs, announces the launch of a major activation around handwashing, during which they will be deploying handwashing facilities and handwashing education programming to communities in need, alongside their community water filtration systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"15px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size: 15px;">In conjunction with Global Handwashing Day, which takes place on October 15, Planet Water and its donor partners are engaging in a month of action across six countries &#8211; Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines and Vietnam. Recipient communities in these countries are each receiving an AquaTower community water filtration system, which includes integrated handwashing stations to make handwashing convenient and frequently practiced. Each project is deployed with one year&#8217;s supply of liquid hand soap, together with Planet Water&#8217;s Hygiene Education program, which teaches about germs and how they spread, the importance of how and when to wash hands with soap, and healthy hygiene habits to create a change in behavior and knowledge around water-health and hygiene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"15px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size: 15px;">Enhancing the educational side of this activation in India, Planet Water has collaborated with long-standing partner Sesame Workshop India (SWI). As part of the partnership, SWI is further amplifying the messaging on handwashing in India through its online platforms with educational content and activities featuring Elmo and other well-known Muppets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"15px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;With handwashing becoming increasingly important due to the ongoing pandemic, we felt it was imperative that we help increase awareness of the need for handwashing across the communities in which we operate, and to provide people with the tools and knowledge to make handwashing something they can practice routinely,&#8221; said Mark Steele, CEO and Founder of Planet Water Foundation. &#8220;Handwashing has been a key part of our hygiene education program for over 10 years, and thanks to the support of our donor partners, we are pleased to be able to make such a positive contribution with this activation.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"15px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size: 15px;">Project supporters this year include Xylem, Watts Water Technologies, Inc., The Starbucks Foundation, SWM International, Freudenberg, and Columbia Sportswear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>2021 commitment marks 11th year of partnership</strong></p>
<p>Planet Water Foundation, a leading non-profit organization in the fight against global water poverty, has announced the extension of its partnership with The Starbucks Foundation.</p>
<p>With the partnership entering its 11th year, the two organizations have committed to deliver community-level clean water projects across eight countries in 2021 – reaching a combined total of 18,000 people in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>With support from The Starbucks Foundation, Planet Water Foundation will deploy 10 AquaTower community level water filtration systems over the course of 2021. Each AquaTower can deliver 1,000 liters of clean drinking water per hour, enough to meet the drinking water requirements of up to 1,800 people. The AquaTower includes six faucets and three integrated soap dispensers at the bottom of the tower, which enables it to serve as a handwashing station, and is deployed in conjunction with Planet Water Foundation’s Water Health and Hygiene education program to teach children healthy hygiene habits and to create a change in behavior and knowledge around water-health and hygiene.</p>
<p>In addition, Starbucks partners (employees) in each country will support project deployments as volunteers, including supporting on-site assembly of the water filtration systems and leading water health and hygiene education activities for students and community members. The recipient communities in 2021 range from a rural school in Siem Reap, Cambodia to a coffee-growing community in Lam Dong, Vietnam.</p>
<p>“As we have grown our partnership with Planet Water Foundation from the first AquaTower in Indonesia to now having reached more than 25 communities across seven countries, we are proud to have been able to deliver life-changing access to clean drinking water to nearly 50,000 people” said Aldrinana Leung, senior manager with The Starbucks Foundation. “We look forward to our continued partnership with Planet Water Foundation and participation of Starbucks partner volunteers who share a passion for strengthening their communities, especially at a time when access to clean, safe water is more important than ever.”</p>
<p>“We are extremely thankful for the many years of support we have received from The Starbucks Foundation, and to be expanding our partnership together this year” said Mark Steele, CEO and Founder of Planet Water Foundation. “It’s through our partnerships with organizations like Starbucks and The Starbucks Foundation that we are able to continue making such a significant impact in the fight against global water poverty.”</p>

<p style="font-size:15px"><strong>&#8220;Project 24&#8221; week of action sees water filtration systems deployed in&nbsp;Cambodia,&nbsp;India,&nbsp;Mexico,&nbsp;Philippines, and&nbsp;Vietnam</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:15px">March 22, 2021 &#8211; Planet Water Foundation, a leading non-profit in the fight against water poverty, announces the completion of Project 24, its initiative to make a life-changing impact in communities which lack access to clean water.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">With the support of its corporate partners, Planet Water has successfully deployed 19 projects providing access to clean, safe drinking water for up to 34,200 people across five countries. Recipient communities each received an AquaTower community water filtration system, which removes viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and other contaminants, and meets the daily drinking water requirement of up to 1,800 people. Each tower includes an integrated handwashing station with three liquid soap dispensers and six water access points to make handwashing convenient and frequently practiced.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">This marks the seventh year of Project 24 and this year Planet Water has enhanced its support for communities by integrating the AquaSan, the organization&#8217;s new surface disinfection system that provides sanitization capabilities to World Health Organization standards, into its projects. All recipient communities also received Planet Water&#8217;s Hygiene Education program which teaches healthy hygiene habits to children and caregivers to create a change in behavior and knowledge around water-health and hygiene.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">&#8220;This past year has been especially challenging due to Covid-19, but we continue to make a much needed impact in the communities where we operate thanks to the support of our donor partners,&#8221; said&nbsp;Mark Steele, CEO and Founder of Planet Water Foundation. &#8220;We have adapted our solutions to provide an even greater impact this year, with all beneficiary schools receiving one year&#8217;s supply of hand soap, and additional educational materials to reflect the increased importance of proper handwashing.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">Project 24 is just the beginning of Planet Water&#8217;s involvement with these communities. As with all projects, Planet Water will carry out sustainability visits over the course of four years to ensure all the systems are working as designed and&nbsp;maintained properly.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">This year&#8217;s Project 24 supporters include Xylem, Electrolux, Watts Water Technologies, Inc., NortonLifeLock, Hung Yen Knitting &amp; Dyeing Co. Ltd., BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company), Ludacka Wealth Partners, Freudenberg, Hilton Effect Foundation,&nbsp;Ingersoll Rand, Capital One, and Expedia.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px">November 3, 2020 &#8211;&nbsp;Electrolux, a global leader in household appliances and appliances for professional use, and Planet Water Foundation, a non-profit organization addressing global water poverty, have moved together in response to the unprecedented flooding in Banteay Meanchey Province, Cambodia.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">Extreme rainfall typhoons since early October in&nbsp;Cambodia&nbsp;have caused unprecedented deadly floods and landslides. In the worst-hit province of Banteay Meanchey, over 4,200 families have been forced to evacuate and are currently living in makeshift tents positioned on the main highways which are elevated above their flooded villages. Access to food, water, and basic sanitation has been a major struggle for these families.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">Electrolux immediately responded to the critical need for potable water by sponsoring two Planet Water AquaBlock systems that produce 1,500 liters of clean water per hour. Under the direction of the Banteay Meanchey Provincial authorities, Planet Water&#8217;s&nbsp;Cambodia&nbsp;team, over the past several days, have mobilized the water supply systems to support 3,632 families (16,344 people) in the Bot Trang and Se Soen emergency encampments in Banteay Meanchey.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">This builds on the partnership established earlier this year to bring access to clean, safe water to schools in six communities across&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Philippines, with funding provided by Electrolux in 2020.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">&#8220;Our hearts and thoughts go out to the families and communities affected by the terrible flooding in Banteay Meanchey. We are thankful for the opportunity to support the emergency efforts. In times like this every single bit of support helps and we hope that our contribution will improve the daily lives of this community as they go through these challenging times,&#8221; says&nbsp;Adam Cich, CEO, Electrolux APAC &amp; MEA.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">&#8220;Fast response is critical in emergencies like this, and thanks to Electrolux&#8217;s support, Planet Water was able to mobilize our systems and deliver access to clean water to impacted communities within 48 hours,&#8221; said&nbsp;Mark Steele, Founder and CEO of Planet Water Foundation.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size:15px"><em><strong>Partnership brings handwashing facilities to schools at a time when they are needed more than ever</strong></em></p>



<p style="font-size:15px">Planet Water Foundation. a nonprofit organization that addresses global water poverty by providing clean water access and hygiene education programs, and Hung Yen Knitting &amp; Dyeing Co. Ltd, a leading textile manufacturer, are launching a partnership to bring handwashing and clean drinking water facilities into schools in Vietnam.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">The partnership will see Planet Water&#8217;s AquaTower, an integrated solution for safe, healthy schools, installed in three communities in&nbsp;Hung Yen&nbsp;province,&nbsp;Vietnam, bringing benefits to over 5,000 people. In addition, Hung Yen Knitting &amp; Dyeing Co. Ltd, will be supporting the provision of three Community Education programs which will be conducted by Planet Water&#8217;s team of educators, providing education to members of the community on best practices around handwashing and the spreading of germs.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">Under the partnership, teams of volunteers from Hung Yen Knitting &amp; Dyeing will support the AquaTower installations, making a meaningful contribution to the communities in which the projects will be installed.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">Global Handwashing Day takes place on&nbsp;October 15, and is a global advocacy day dedicated to increasing awareness and understanding about the importance of handwashing with soap as an effective and affordable way to prevent diseases and save lives.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">&#8220;We are honored to be expanding our presence in&nbsp;Vietnam&nbsp;thanks to the support of Hung Yen Knitting &amp; Dyeing Co, Ltd,&#8221; said&nbsp;Mark Steele, Founder &amp; CEO of Planet Water Foundation. &#8220;Handwashing facilities and access to safe, clean drinking water are more important today than ever before and we have therefore made handwashing a focal point of all our programs, including providing one year&#8217;s supply of hand soap with all our AquaTower deployments, and strengthening the handwashing content included in our education programming.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size:15px">July 21, 2020 &#8211; Planet Water Foundation, a leading non-profit organization that addresses global water poverty by providing clean water access and hygiene education programs, and Electrolux, a global leader in household appliances, are launching a partnership to assist schools with COVID-19 recovery in communities located in Indonesia and the Philippines beginning July 8.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">Under the new partnership, a target of 10,000 people will benefit from Planet Water&#8217;s integrated solution for safe, healthy schools that will be located in six communities across&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Philippines, with funding provided by Electrolux in 2020. As a result, access to clean, safe drinking water, hand washing facilities, and hygiene education will be provided to community schools to enable their COVID-19 recovery process. Additionally, 10 families in&nbsp;Cambodia&nbsp;will receive Planet Water&#8217;s AquaHome systems that include water filtration and solar electricity with LED lighting. Electrolux&#8217;s involvement will give their employees the opportunity to volunteer in AquaTower system installations and participate with students and teachers during Planet Water&#8217;s Water-Health and Hygiene Education Program. This will ultimately improve the health and wellbeing of children through interactive teaching modules that include how to prevent the spread of germs by properly washing hands.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">According to the UN, nearly one billion people worldwide do not have access to potable water, and 40-percent of people worldwide do not have a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home. Planet Water Foundation addresses these issues with its community-based AquaTower water filtration system that removes viruses, bacteria, protozoa and other contaminants, and meets the daily drinking water requirement of up to 1,800 people. Systems include six water access points and three liquid soap dispensers to make handwashing convenient and more frequently practiced.</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">&#8220;Electrolux has made a significant commitment to aiding us in global water poverty mitigation and in the COVID-19 recovery process for community schools,&#8221; said&nbsp;Mark Steele, Founder and CEO of Planet Water Foundation. &#8220;Our goal is to alleviate water poverty in the world&#8217;s most impoverished communities through sustainable, clean water solutions and education programs on water-health and hygiene. Partnering with Electrolux helps us take steps toward this goal with maximum impact.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">&#8220;We are thankful for the opportunity that Planet Water Foundation has offered us to demonstrate our purpose to Shape Living for the Better. It is in these critical times that companies need to act more on their purpose and core values. Our partnership has allowed us to access under-privileged communities that don&#8217;t have the basic needs of clean &amp; safe water. Knowing the impact of our mutual support and seeing the overwhelming emotions on children and parents&#8217; faces, as we conclude each installation, is just priceless. And that&#8217;s a motive for us to continue in our journey to support more communities within our region,&#8221; said&nbsp;Adam Cich, Executive Vice President and Head of Electrolux APAC &amp; MEA.</p>

<p>Leaving our planet, and the people who voyage upon it, better than when we arrived is more than a philosophy – it is a mutual commitment that forms the cornerstone of a unique partnership between Columbia Sportswear, their supplier partners and Planet Water Foundation that began in 2016. Today, we are supporting the daily need for clean, safe drinking water access in nine communities within their supply chain locations in Vietnam, India and the Philippines. By the end of 2022 we will reach 25 communities supported with Planet Water AquaTowers and Water-Health and Hygiene Education programs.</p>
